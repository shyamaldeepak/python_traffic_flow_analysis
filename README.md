A comprehensive toolkit for traffic flow analysis and visualization in Python. This project leverages libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and pandas to process video feeds, perform vehicle detection, and compute metrics such as flow rate and density. Ideal for transportation studies and smart city applications.
This version is structured for clarity and readability, making it easy for visitors to quickly understand your project's value.

üö¶ Lane-wise Traffic Vehicle Counter using YOLOv8
An AI-powered system to detect, track, and count vehicles lane-by-lane in real-time from video streams. Built with YOLOv8 and OpenCV, this project prevents duplicate counts by registering vehicles only as they cross a designated virtual line. The entire system is optimized to run seamlessly in a Google Colab environment.

üìå Key Features
Accurate Multi-Class Detection: Identifies and categorizes various vehicle types, including cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles.

Advanced Object Tracking: Employs a robust tracking algorithm (IoU + Hungarian method) to maintain a unique ID for each vehicle across frames.

Precise Line-Crossing Logic: Counts a vehicle exactly once when its centroid crosses a pre-defined line in the correct lane, eliminating errors from vehicles changing lanes or stopping.

Data Export: Automatically generates a CSV file with detailed results (Vehicle ID, Lane, Timestamp) for further analysis.

Rich Visualization: Produces an annotated output video showing bounding boxes, tracking IDs, counting lines, and a live dashboard of lane-by-lane counts.

‚òÅÔ∏è Colab Ready: Designed for easy setup and execution in Google Colab, with helpers for downloading source videos directly from YouTube.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

üöÄ How It Works
Input: The system takes a video file or a YouTube URL as input.

Detection: YOLOv8 processes each frame to find and classify all vehicles.

Tracking: Each detected vehicle is assigned a unique ID, which is tracked across subsequent frames.

Counting: When a vehicle's tracked centroid crosses a designated counting line for its lane, its count is registered and stored.

Output: The system produces an annotated video and a CSV file with the final counts and tracking data.

üí° Potential Applications
Smart city traffic monitoring and analysis.

Road usage and lane performance analytics.

Data collection for adaptive traffic signal control.

Real-time traffic management and congestion detection.
